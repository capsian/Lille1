This software is a free software. See COPYING.
It was written by François Boulier in February 2006 (boulier@lifl.fr).
The design and the implementation could certainly be improved.
 
It provides a teaching version of the Dantzig algorithm.

The already compiled version
----------------------------

If your machine is a recent PC under Linux, you may try the executable 
file "simplex" which is an already compiled version.

If your machine is a PC under WINDOWS, you may try the executable
"simplex.exe" which is an already compiled version, too.

Recompiling it from scratch
---------------------------

It requires 
- the BLAD libraries (1.6 or +) (URL http://www.lifl.fr/~boulier/BLAD) and
- the GMP library (4.1 or +) (URL http://swox.com/gmp).

To recompile it, you probably need to update the makefile.

If you are using a PC under Linux, GMP is probably already installed
but you probably need to install BLAD. I suggest you download the BLAD
library, and that you configure it using "--prefix=$HOME/biblad32" so
that BLAD gets installed in that library.

To build "simplex", enter

make

Using the software
------------------

After building

./simplex boulanger

Linear programs under canonical form may be solved through their dual 
programs. To do this, try

./simplex -dual boulanger

Looking at the examples you should figure out how to write your own 
linear programs.

About the algorithm
-------------------

General linear programs are solved using the two phases methods.

The dual construction is only implemented for canonical linear programs.

The implemented strategy is a non guaranteed one. 

The linear program "non_terminating" enters an infinite loop.

The linear program "exponential" is a special case of a generic
linear program which leads the algorithm to 2**n loops where n
denotes the number of constraints.
