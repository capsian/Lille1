I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\\r\\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\\r\\nof my undertaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\\r\\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\\r\\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\\r\\nfeeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\\r\\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\\r\\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\\r\\nand vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\\r\\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\\r\\nregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\\r\\n'"
